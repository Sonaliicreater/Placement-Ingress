# Placement-Ingress

We have created an automatic training and placement application that would enable training and placement officers to perform more efficiently in college placement and, as a result, every student would be able to get a job and take advantage of the opportunity. Students must travel to the placement office to have access to this system. Using the appropriate login credentials Not just the students, but also the training and placement are all part of the programme. Officers can use this system to manage student information and placement activities that will assist the training and placement faculty in effectively managing placements efficiently.
